# primes
Experiments with different ways of calculating the number of primes below 100000 and getting that number:
<br>
First 4 java files in project:<br>
+1 Primes.java is a very brute force way of calculating the number of primes below 100.000<br>
+2 PrimesV2.java breakes when it finds that the number being checked is not a prime<br>
+3 PrimesV3.java is only looking at odd numbers and only checking dividers up to the square root of the number being checked<br>
+4 PrimesV4.java is a threaded version of PrimesV3.java<br>
